# js-tic-tac-toe
In this activity, we will be practicing for loops and nested arrays by recreating a childhood game called Tic-Tac-Toe.

In this familiar game, one player is assigned “X” and the other player is assigned “O”. Players alternate drawing their
character within cells on a 3x3 grid. The first player to have three of their characters in a row—horizontal, vertical,
or diagonal—wins.

The game can end in a tie, meaning all cells are filled but no player achieved three-in-a-row.
